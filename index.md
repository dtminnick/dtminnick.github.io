### Cyclistic Analysis and Presentation

[Presentation](https://github.com/dtminnick/cyclistic/blob/main/inst/extdata/reference/Cyclistic%20Marketing%20Strategy%20Recommendations.pdf) I developed as part of the case study for the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate program.  Details of my analysis are contained in [this Github repository](https://github.com/dtminnick/cyclistic).

### Sunspot Data

[Consolidated sunspot dataset](https://github.com/dtminnick/sunspot) I created from 143 fixed-width ASCII files on NASA's Solar Physics website, containing records for sunspot observations for the years 1874 through 2016.

### R Codebits

Useful codebits I developed to streamline and solve data analysis problems.

[Count active events](https://github.com/dtminnick/codebits/blob/main/R/count_by_hour_interval.md) by hour interval.

[Create a Likert diverging stacked bar chart](https://github.com/dtminnick/codebits/blob/main/R/likert_diverging_stacked_chart.md) using the `ggstats` library.

[Create a sankey chart](https://github.com/dtminnick/codebits/blob/main/R/sankey_chart.md) to visualize a process flow.

[Generate a calendar table](https://github.com/dtminnick/codebits/blob/main/R/create_calendar_table.md) using the `dplyr` library.

[Generate a frequency distribution table](https://github.com/dtminnick/codebits/blob/main/R/frequency_distribution_table.md) using the `dplyr` library.

[List and import files](https://github.com/dtminnick/codebits/blob/main/R/list_and_extract_aws_files.md) from the Amazon cloud storage using the `aws.s2` library.

[Reconcile record counts](https://github.com/dtminnick/codebits/blob/main/R/file_reconciliation.md) when combining multiple files.
